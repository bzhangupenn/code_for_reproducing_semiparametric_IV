Code for implementing a semiparametric IV estimator and reproducing results for the case study.

File `code_sigma.R' and `code_sigma_Z.R' contains functions for implementing the semiparametric estimator, one with a homoskedastic error, and the other with a heteroskedastic error. 

File `real_data_github.R' contains code that illustrate how to do a real data analysis using some randomly generated data contained in the file `generated_data.csv'.
